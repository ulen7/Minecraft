Welcome to my Minecraft server setup project! I started this as a way to host a fun and safe server for my kid, and along the way, I took it as an opportunity to learn and improve my skills in Docker, Linux, modding, automation, and remote networking.

This repository documents my journey in setting up a personal, modded Minecraft server for my family. What started as a simple server has become a fun learning project involving **Docker**, **Fabric mods**, **Tailscale** for remote access, and **automated backups** to Google Drive.

My goal is to continuously improve this setup, learn as I go, and create a comprehensive guide for others who might want to do the same.

### ✨ Core Features

* **Containerized with Docker:** Easy to manage, deploy, and replicate the server environment.
* **Modded with Fabric:** Running a lightweight, moddable server version.
* **Secure Remote Access:** Using [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) to create a secure network for remote play.
* **Automated Backups:** Nightly backups of the world data are automatically created and uploaded to Google Drive, so we never lose our progress.
