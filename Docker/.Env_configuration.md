# ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables & Docker Compose Example

This section explains how to use a `.env` file to simplify Docker Compose configuration and maintain flexibility when changing server versions, ports, or file paths.

## üìÑ What is a `.env` file?

A `.env` file lets you define key-value pairs that can be referenced inside your `docker-compose.yml`. This keeps sensitive or editable values outside the compose file and improves reusability.

**Example `.env` file:**

```env
# Docker container settings
MC_SERVER_NAME=mc_servername
VERSION=1.25.1
# Port for Minecraft java
JPORT=25565
# Port for Minecraft bedrock
BPORT=19132

# Minecraft server properties
SEED=
# Memory limits
MEM_MIN=1G
MEM_MAX=4G
MODE=survival

# Paths (mounted from host)
DATA_PATH=/home/server_name/minecraft_servers/${MC_SERVER_NAME}
